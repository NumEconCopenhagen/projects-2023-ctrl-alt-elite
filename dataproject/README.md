# Data analysis project

Our project is titled ***The relationship between renewable electricity generation and demand in Denmark*** and is about how much megawatt per hour the different electricity generation types produce. We look at gross consumption, offshore windfarms, onshore windfarms, solar power and hydro power.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following API url**:

1.  'https://api.energidataservice.dk/dataset/ProductionConsumptionSettlement?offset=0&start=2022-01-01T00:00&end=2023-01-01T00:00&sort=HourUTC%20DESC&timezone=dk'

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``!pip install requests``
