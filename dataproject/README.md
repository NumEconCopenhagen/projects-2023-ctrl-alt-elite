# Data analysis project

Our project is titled "Electricity Generation in Denmark by Source" and is about how much megawatt per hour the different electricity generation types produce. We look at gros consumption, offshore windfarms, onshore windfarms, solar power and hydro power.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following API url**:
