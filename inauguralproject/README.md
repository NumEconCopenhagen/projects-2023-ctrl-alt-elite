# Inaugural project

In this project we solve a simple economic model where we consider households with a male and female member and seek to maximize utility.

We utilize the Household Specialization Model and solve the model with both discrete and continous solvers.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
